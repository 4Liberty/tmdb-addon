**The Movie Database Addon** was intended to address some deficiencies in Stremio, such as title information in other languages and to add new titles that do not exist in Stremio.

# How to install

To install TMDB Addons just enter the community's addons catalog, search for TMDB Addon, click on configure, choose your language and click on install, you will be redirected to Stremio and just click on install.

You can also do this through this link: [TMDB Addon Page](https://94c8cb9f702d-tmdb-addon.baby-beamup.club/configure)

# Pros

1 - Information in your language:
 - Title name
 - Poster 
 - Description
 - Trailers
 - Episode title
 - Episode description

2 - Add titles that do not exist in Stremio:

Example this 2017 series, on the left the result using the standard Stremio catalog, on the right the result using TMDB Addon.

3 - You are free to correct wrong information, just correct the information on the TMDB website and the Addon will update automatically.

# Cons

1 - Some information may not be right, the Addon does not check the information it accesses the TMDB API directly.
